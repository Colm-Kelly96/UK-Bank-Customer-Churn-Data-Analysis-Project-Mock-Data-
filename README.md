## 🎯 Project Overview

Interactive data analysis dashboard built to demonstrate advanced SQL, Python, and data visualization skills for product analytics project. This project showcases end-to-end data product development using LLM-assisted workflows.

**Live Dashboard:** [Add your Streamlit URL here]

## 📊 Key Features

- **Advanced SQL Analysis**: Complex joins, CTEs, and window functions across 5 normalized tables
- **Interactive Visualizations**: Built with Plotly for dynamic data exploration
- **Risk Scoring Model**: Automated customer segmentation for retention targeting
- **Strategic Insights**: Data-driven recommendations with quantified business impact
- **LLM-Assisted Development**: Documented workflow showing AI-enhanced productivity

## 🏦 Business Context

Analysis of 10,000 UK banking customers to identify churn drivers and optimize retention strategy. Key findings:

- **36.9% churn rate** for single-product customers (6x baseline)
- **65% churn rate** for customers with unresolved complaints
- **High-risk segments identified**: 2,545 customers requiring immediate intervention
- **ROI projection**: ~1,800 customers saved through targeted campaigns

## 🛠️ Technical Stack

- **Database**: SQLite (normalized schema across 5 tables)
- **Analysis**: Python (pandas for data manipulation)
- **Visualization**: Streamlit + Plotly for interactive dashboards
- **Deployment**: Streamlit Cloud
- **Development**: LLM-assisted coding (Claude/ChatGPT) for rapid prototyping

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Run Locally

```bash
# Clone repository
git clone [your-repo-url]
cd bank-churn-analysis

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Run dashboard

```

## 📈 Key SQL Queries Demonstrated

### Customer Segmentation by Product Count
```sql
SELECT 
    num_products,
    COUNT(*) as total_customers,
    SUM(has_exited) as churned,
    ROUND(AVG(has_exited) * 100, 1) as churn_rate
FROM accounts a
JOIN churn ch ON a.customer_id = ch.customer_id
GROUP BY num_products
ORDER BY num_products;
```

## 💡 Strategic Insights Generated

### Immediate Actions (0-30 days)
1. **Cross-Sell Campaign**: Target 4,734 single-product customers → Save ~1,500 customers
2. **Complaint Fast-Track**: 48-hour resolution SLA → Save ~75 customers
3. **Inactive Re-activation**: Push notifications + gamification → Save ~229 customers
